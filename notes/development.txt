NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS



Using Arduino IDE.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This project is organized as an Arduino sketchbook, with
all libraries stored within the libraries subfolder,
and all arduino sketches in separate folders.

In Arduino IDE, you must set this project's arduino folder
as the Sketchbook location.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Third-party libraries must be imported into the libraries
folder via "git submodule add [url...]"

This organization ensures all developers start with common
libraries.

Custom libraries can be added to the library folder in your
own branch or fork of this project.  Alternatively, you can
store sketch-specific library files in your sketch folders.
