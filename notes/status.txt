Ryan's near-term goals:
0) setup event-based framework
1) push VHF rx i2s-in, buffering, and event handler to teanc library
2) update VHF rx websockets demo
3) make VHF rx websockets recorder to support offboard demod dev
4) make VHF tx i2s-out handler
5) make VHF mode switching via http
6) make walkie-talkie demo
7) begin onboard demodulation dev






TEANC CORE OBJECT:

  Wifi
    done:   preferred and fallback configs
    to-do:  add power state handler
    
  VHF
    done:   serial
    done:   control object (via submodule)
    to-do:  rx handling
            done:  proof of concept (websockets example)
            to-do: push i2s-in and buffer handling into teanc library
            to-do: rx samples-ready event handler
    to-do:  tx handling
    to-do:  mode switching
    to-do:  power control
            power-on is done
            to-do: seamless transition
    
  GPS
    to-do:  move into teanc library
    to-do:  add power state handler
    
  LCD - to-do (low priority)


  
  

EXAMPLE SKETCHES:
  done:
    gps rx -> usb serial demo
  
  prototyped:
    vhf rx -> websockets demo
    basic interfaces demo
  
  to-do:
    vhf rx -> websockets -> data file (for demod dev)
    vhf <-> websockets walkie-talkie
  
  eventually:
    offboard (browser-based) APRS 
    onboard APRS demodulation and igate
    onboard APRS modulation and beacon/transponder
    onboard APRS 2-way, KISS protocol over BLE to APRSdroid
    multi-node team tracker

  
  
  
GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY:
  Wifi multi-config handler - prototyped
  Wifi http server

  Turn GPS on and off as needed
  Turn VHF on and off as needed
  Turn LCD on and off as needed
  Turn Wifi on and off as needed
  
  VHF tx/rx mode switching
  KISS protocol
